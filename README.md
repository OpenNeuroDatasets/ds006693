# NODEAP: Distinct contributions of anterior and posterior OFC to outcome-guided behavior

**Summary**  
This dataset includes defaced anatomical T1-weighted MRI and raw multi-echo resting-state fMRI data from a study investigating the distinct roles of the anterior (aOFC) and posterior (pOFC) lateral orbitofrontal cortex in outcome-guided (goal-directed) behavior.  
Participants underwent odorâ€“reward learning and outcome devaluation across multiple sessions. To probe causal contributions of OFC subregions, network-targeted TMS was applied to either aOFC or pOFC in separate sessions, and its effects on learning versus inference were assessed.

**Participants**  
- N = 48 healthy adults  
- See `participants.tsv` for sex, age, stimulation group (aOFC vs. pOFC), and counterbalanced TMS and meal orders  

**Sessions / tasks**  
Each subject may have several MRI sessions; session labels match the original collection schedule:  
- `ses-D0` â€“ baseline/resting-state MRI (no devaluation).  
- `ses-S1D1`, `ses-S1D2`, `ses-S2D1`, `ses-S2D2`, `ses-S3D1`, `ses-S3D2` â€“ study days spanning learning (Day 1) and post-meal devaluation/choice (Day 2). Some sessions include network-targeted TMS (aOFC or pOFC).  
- Functional scans are resting-state; multi-echo acquisitions are provided as separate echoes.

**Whatâ€™s included**  
- `sub-*/anat/`  
  - Defaced T1w MRI: `sub-XX_T1w.nii.gz` (+ JSON sidecar if available).  
- `sub-*/ses-*/func/`  
  - Raw multi-echo BOLD: `sub-XX_ses-YY_task-rest_run-01_echo-{1,2,3}_bold.nii.gz` (+ matching JSON sidecars when available).  
- Top-level: `dataset_description.json`, `participants.tsv`, `participants.json`, `README.md`.

**Notes on data quality & privacy**  
- T1w images were defaced prior to sharing.  
- Functional files are raw (converted with dcm2niix); files with SPM-style prefixes (r/w/y/s*) were excluded.
